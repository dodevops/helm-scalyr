## Introduction

This helm chart installs the [Scalyr Agent monitor](https://app.scalyr.com/help/scalyr-agent) into a Kubernetes
cluster. It supports installing the agent with all features required to support a Kubernetes cluster monitoring.
Additionally, it can deploy Scalyr agents which monitor other parts of the infrastructure (for example a hosted
database service etc.).

This chart is not affiliated with Scalyr, Inc. in any way. For support, please open an issue in this
project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/dodevops/helm-scalyr/issues).

## Installation

Use

    helm install <name of release> scalyr-agent --repo https://dodevops.io/helm-scalyr

to install this chart.

## Configuration

Two basic configuration keys have to be set up to allow logging to Scalyr cloud:

* scalyr.server: The name of the Scalyr api server (defaults to scalyr.com)
* scalyr.apiKey: The api key used to authenticate to the Scalyr api server
* scalyr.config: The Scalyr configuration

The scalyr configuration is done using the
[configuration map approach](https://app.scalyr.com/help/scalyr-agent-k8s#modify-config). This is basically a key/value
hash. The keys refer to the configuration file name for grouping monitors. The value is the Scalyr json configuration
for each monitor.

This chart's default values are set to support the monitoring of a Kubernetes cluster. The only value you have
to set manually is:

* config.k8s.clusterName: name of the Kubernetes cluster to monitor (will be visible in the Scalyr UI)

If you want to monitor additional things outside of Kubernetes (e.g. Databases), you can set the following values:

* controllerType: For other monitors, it is usually best to set this to "deployment" instead of "daemonset"
* supportK8s: Set this to false to remove the serviceaccount, clusterroles and additional mounts to the Scalyr
 agent pods

## Controller type

By default, this chart creates a daemonset which is the recommended deployment pattern for Kubernetes monitoring.

If you'd like to create a different Scalyr agent, you can set `controllerType` to "deployment" and set `supportK8s` to
false.
